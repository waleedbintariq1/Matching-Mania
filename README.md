# Matching-Mania
A take on the popular game Candy Crush. Developed using C++ and displayed on the command line user interface.

# Algorithm:
1. Make a board of random 5 colors.
2. Take input from the user about which cell to       select and with which cell to swap the selected      cell.
3. Swap the cells.
4. If a chain ( 3 same colors ) is formed       horizontally or vertically then replace this 
   chain with zeroes (to show chain has destroyed).
5. Else swap the cells back to their original positions and output "Swap not possible".
6. Repeat step 1 to 5 until game ends. 

# Features
